    You are a knowledge graph extraction assistant. Combining knowledge from other relevant knowledge graphs, you are responsible for extracting attributes and relationships related to the specified entity from the text.
    Text: {text}
    Specified entity: {target_entity}
    Relevant knowledge graphs: {related_kg}
    Requirements for you:
    1. You should comprehensively analyze the entire text and extract relationships related to the specified entity. A subgraph should be established for the specified entity.
    2. You should extract both the attributes of the specified entity and the relationships between the specified entity and other entities.
        For attribute extraction: Attributes describe the characteristics of the specified entity. For example, in "Jordan - Gender: Male," gender is an attribute.
        For relationship extraction, the head entity of the relationship must be the specified entity. For example, "Specified entity - Has - Other entity" is valid, while "Other entity - Is owned by - Specified entity" is invalid.
    3. You should determine when to classify information as a relationship and when to classify it as an attribute.
    4. Knowledge from other relevant knowledge graphs can help you more comprehensively understand the characteristics of the specified entity. Moreover, you should use this knowledge to establish reverse relationships for the specified entity, forming bidirectional relationships. For example, if "Other entity - Wife - Specified entity," you should establish "Specified entity - Husband - Other entity" to make the knowledge graph more comprehensive.
    5. In the final output, duplicate attributes should be retained only once, and duplicate relationships should be retained only once.
    6. The final output format should be:
        {{
    "central_entity": {{
        "name": "{{}}",
        "type": "{{}}",
        "attributes": [

Requirements for you:
1. You should integrate the entire text to comprehensively extract relationships related to the specified entity and build a sub-graph for the specified entity.
2. You should extract attributes of the specified entity and relationships between the specified entity and other entities.
   - For attribute extraction: Attributes are descriptions of the characteristics of the specified entity. For example, in "Michael Jordan - Gender: Male," gender is an attribute.
   - For relationship extraction, the head entity of the relationship must be the specified entity. For example, "Specified Entity - Owns - Other Entity" is valid, while "Other Entity - Is Owned By - Specified Entity" is invalid.
3. You should determine when to classify information as a relationship and when to classify it as an attribute.
4. Utilize knowledge from other relevant knowledge graphs to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the specified entity's characteristics. You should also establish reverse relationships based on other knowledge to form bidirectional relationships. For example, if there is a relationship like "Other Entity - Wife - Specified Entity," you should establish the reverse relationship: "Specified Entity - Husband - Other Entity" to make the knowledge graph more comprehensive.

You are a named entity recognition assistant responsible for identifying named entities from the given text.
Text: {text}
Notes:
1. First, you should determine whether the text contains any information. If it's just meaningless symbols, directly output: {{State : False}}. If the text contains information, proceed to the next step.
2. You should consider the entire text for named entity recognition.
3. The identified entities should consist of three parts: name, type, and description.
    - name: The main subject of the named entity.
    - type: The category of the subject.
    - description: A summary description of the subject, explaining what it is.
4. Since multiple named entities may be identified in a single text, you need to output them in a specific format.
    The output format should be:

            "name": "Entity Name 1",
